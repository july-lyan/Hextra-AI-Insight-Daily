It features a 5.5-inch holographic capsule housing an anime-style girl that can even monitor your screen and your presence. Currently, 5 character options are available, including the anime girl Kira and the muscular Zane. Pre-orders are just $20, and the company boldly claims it will sell **a billion units**. Though, Grok's "flirty" style has apparently been inherited too.

4.  **Liquid AI releases LFM2.5 small model family for edge devices.**
    Liquid AI has released its LFM2.5 family of small models for edge devices. Specifically designed for edge devices and local deployment, these 1.2B parameter models still managed to score **38.89 on GPQA**. The [Open-Source Weights (AI News)](https://www.liquid.ai/blog/introducing-lfm2-5-the-next-generation-of-on-device-ai) have already been released on Hugging Face. The family also includes a Japanese-specialized version, a vision-language version, and an audio-language version. Notably, the audio model's anti-tokenizer speed is **8 times faster** than before, making it perfect for real-time voice conversations.<br/>![AI News: LFM2.5 Model Performance Benchmark Comparison Chart](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kechsyx9eyhvmb7890y28cwx.avif)<br/>

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **VTONQA: First virtual try-on quality assessment dataset released.**
    VTONQA, the first virtual try-on quality assessment dataset, has been released. Virtual try-on images for online shopping often get distorted or look wonky, but now there's a dedicated evaluation standard. The [arXiv Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02945) reveals that the dataset contains **8,132 images** generated by 11 try-on models, with scores across three dimensions: garment fit, body compatibility, and overall quality. This release highlights the limitations of existing models and provides clear direction for developers.

2.  **CodeEvolve: Open-source evolutionary code generation framework.**
    CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary code generation framework, has been launched. It combines large models with evolutionary search to synthesize high-performance algorithms. The [GitHub Open Source (AI News)](https://github.com/inter-co/science-codeevolve) repository shows it outperforms AlphaEvolve in benchmark tests. It's pretty wild that an open-source model can rival closed-source solutions, and with **just a fraction of the computational cost**!

### Industry Outlook & Social Impact

1.  **Andrew Ng proposes a new "Turing-AGI Test" standard.**
    Andrew Ng has proposed a new "Turing-AGI Test" standard. For his first tweet of the new year, instead of predicting AI's prowess, he's asking how we'll know if AGI has truly arrived. [Andrew Ng's Tweet (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/2008709530654216567) suggests: Give an AI an internet-connected computer, let it work continuously for several days like a remote employee—receiving training, handling customers, and getting feedback. If it performs as well as a skilled human employee, it passes. Interestingly, for the classic Turing Test, the most effective method was **deliberately making typos**!

2.  **Nvidia unveils its Vera Rubin platform.**
    Nvidia has unveiled its Vera Rubin platform. At CES, Nvidia dropped a bombshell with this new platform. It only requires **a quarter** of the chips needed by Blackwell to train a 10-trillion-parameter model, cutting the training time down to just one month. [Inference Cost (AI News)](https://x.com/vista8/status/2008876426255270106) will be slashed to a mere tenth, with shipments planned for the second half of the year.

3.  **Reddit post with thousands of upvotes confirmed as AI-fabricated.**
    A Reddit post, claiming to expose food delivery platform fraud, has been confirmed as AI-fabricated. This bombshell post garnered **87,000 upvotes**, but it turns out to be AI-generated. An [AIbase Report (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24336) indicates that the so-called "employee ID" and 18 pages of "technical documentation" all bore AI traces. Interestingly, the scam was also debunked by AI—using Google Gemini's SynthID watermarking technology.

4.  **AI penetration testing agents show impressive performance but have limitations.**
    AI penetration testing agents show impressive performance but have limitations. Stanford research reveals that AI penetration bots cost less than **$60/hour** and can defeat 9 out of 10 human testers. However, a [HackerNews Discussion (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46518996) points out that about 18% were false positives, and they also missed obvious vulnerabilities. While network penetration has become highly automated, application-layer testing still requires human judgment.
