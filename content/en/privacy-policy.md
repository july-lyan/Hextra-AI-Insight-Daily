# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: June 1, 2025*

---

Hey there! 👋 This Privacy Policy breaks down our approach to collecting, using, and sharing your info when you use our Service. It's also here to tell you about your privacy rights and how the law's got your back.

We're all about using your personal data to give you the best possible Service and keep improving it. By diving in and using our Service, you're essentially saying "Yep!" to us collecting and using your info as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

## Interpretation and Definitions

### Interpretation
Let's get clear on some terms! 🧐 Words capitalized here mean what's defined below, no matter if they're singular or plural.

### Definitions
For the record, in this Privacy Policy:

- **Account** means your unique spot, created just for you, to hop into our Service or parts of it.

- **Affiliate** refers to any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with us. "Control" here means owning 50% or more of the shares, equity, or other securities that can vote for directors or other managing bigwigs.

- **Company** (yep, that's "the Company," "We," "Us," or "Our" in this policy) is **hubtoday**.

- **Cookies** are those tiny files a website pops onto your computer, phone, or any other device. They're packed with details like your browsing history on that site, among other cool stuff. 🍪

- **Country**? That's California, USA for us! 🇺🇸

- **Device** means, well, anything you can use to get to our Service—think computers, cellphones, or even your trusty digital tablet.

- **Personal Data** is any info tied to a specific person who's either identified or identifiable.

- **Service** is just a fancy way of saying "this Website."

- **Service Provider** means any person or company that crunches data for us. Basically, it's those third-party folks or companies we hire to help run our Service, provide it for us, handle service-related tasks, or help us figure out how the Service is being used. They're our trusty sidekicks!

- **Usage Data** is the info that gets collected automatically, like when you use the Service or from the Service's own tech—think how long you hang out on a page.

- **Website** is **hubtoday**, which you can find right here: `https://ai.hubtoday.app/`.

- **You** means, well, you! The person using or checking out our Service. Or, if you're doing this on behalf of a company or legal entity, then that entity.

## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

#### Personal Data
Hey, when you're using our Service, we might ask you for some personal info that helps us get in touch or identify you. This "personally identifiable information" could be things like:

- Email address
- Usage Data

#### Usage Data
Usage Data? That's the stuff we automatically collect whenever you're using the Service.

So, what's in this Usage Data? It could be things like your device's Internet Protocol address (like its digital fingerprint), what browser you're using, which pages on our Service you check out, when you visited, how long you stayed, unique device IDs, and other techy diagnostic info.

Mobile user? 📱 When you hit up our Service on your phone or tablet, we might automatically grab some info like your specific mobile device type, its unique ID, its IP address, your mobile operating system, the kind of mobile Internet browser you're rocking, unique device identifiers, and other diagnostic bits.

And hey, we might also scoop up the info your browser sends our way whenever you visit our Service, whether you're on a desktop or your mobile device.

### Tracking Technologies and Cookies
We're all about using Cookies and similar tracking tech to keep an eye on what's happening on our Service and to save a bit of info. These tracking goodies include beacons, tags, and scripts—all there to gather and track info, helping us make our Service even better and analyze how it's doing. The tech we use might include:

- **Cookies or Browser Cookies**: Think of a Cookie as a tiny file that lands on your device. You can totally tell your browser to refuse all Cookies or to give you a heads-up when one's trying to get sent. But heads up: if you block 'em, you might miss out on some cool parts of our Service. Unless you've specifically told your browser "no thanks" to Cookies, our Service will likely be using them.
- **Web Beacons**: Some parts of our Service and even our emails might have these tiny electronic files called web beacons (you might also hear them called clear gifs, pixel tags, or single-pixel gifs). They're super handy for things like counting how many users have checked out those pages or opened an email, and for other cool website stats—like figuring out how popular a certain section is or making sure our systems and servers are running smoothly.

Okay, so Cookies come in two flavors: "Persistent" or "Session" Cookies. Persistent Cookies stick around on your computer or mobile device even after you've logged off, but Session Cookies? They vanish the moment you close your web browser. Poof! 💨

We're actually using both Session and Persistent Cookies for these reasons:

- **Necessary / Essential Cookies**
  - **Type**: Session Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are like the unsung heroes! They're absolutely crucial for giving you the services available on our Website and letting you use some of its best features. They also help us verify who you are and stop any funny business with user accounts. Seriously, without these Cookies, the services you're asking for just wouldn't happen, and we only use them to make sure you *get* those services.

- **Cookies Policy / Notice Acceptance Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies simply help us remember if you've given us the thumbs-up to use Cookies on the Website.

- **Functionality Cookies**
  - **Type**: Persistent Cookies
  - **Administered by**: Us
  - **Purpose**: These Cookies are pretty neat! They help us recall your choices when you're using the Website—like remembering your login info or what language you prefer. The whole point is to give you a smoother, more personalized experience so you don't have to keep typing in your preferences every single time you visit. ✨

### Use of Your Personal Data
So, the Company might use Personal Data for these cool reasons:

- **To provide and maintain our Service**, which includes keeping tabs on how our Service is being used.
- **To manage Your Account**: This means handling your registration as a Service user. The Personal Data you share lets you tap into all the awesome features available to you as a registered user.
- **For the performance of a contract**: This involves setting up, sticking to, and fulfilling the purchase contract for any products, items, or services you've bought, or any other agreement you've made with us through the Service.
- **To contact You**: We might reach out via email, phone calls, SMS, or other digital ways (like push notifications from a mobile app) to keep you in the loop about updates, features, products, or services you've signed up for—including important security updates—whenever it's necessary or makes sense.
- **To provide You with news**, special deals, and general info about other cool stuff, services, and events we offer that are similar to what you've already checked out or bought. Of course, you can always opt out if you're not into it!
- **To manage Your requests**: We'll handle and manage any requests you send our way.
- **For business transfers**: We might use your info to check out or go through with a merger, sale, restructuring, reorganization, shutdown, or any other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets. This could be part of our ongoing business or a bankruptcy situation, where the Personal Data we have about our Service users is one of those transferred assets.
- **For other purposes**: We might also use your info for things like crunching data, spotting usage trends, figuring out if our promo campaigns are hitting the mark, and generally evaluating and boosting our Service, products, marketing, and your overall experience. Pretty neat, huh?

So, here's when we might share your personal info:

- **With Service Providers**: We might share your personal info with our Service Providers to help us monitor and analyze how our Service is used, and to get in touch with you.
- **For business transfers**: If we're talking mergers, selling off company assets, financing, or another company acquiring all or part of our business, we might share or transfer your personal info during those discussions or processes.
- **With Affiliates**: We might share your info with our affiliates. Don't worry, we'll make sure they play by the rules of this Privacy Policy too! Affiliates include our parent company, any other subsidiaries, joint venture buddies, or other companies we control or are commonly controlled with.
- **With business partners**: We might team up and share your info with our business partners to hook you up with specific products, services, or awesome promotions.
- **With other users**: If you're sharing personal info or chatting it up in public areas with other users, just know that info might be seen by everyone and could even get shared publicly outside our Service. So, share wisely! 😉
- **With Your consent**: If you give us the green light, we can totally spill your personal info for any other reason. Your call!

### Retention of Your Personal Data
The Company will hold onto your Personal Data only for as long as it's truly needed for the reasons explained in this Privacy Policy. We'll also keep and use your data as much as necessary to play by the legal rules (like if a law requires us to keep it), sort out any disagreements, and make sure our legal agreements and policies are followed.

The Company will also hang onto Usage Data for our own internal analysis. Generally, Usage Data sticks around for a shorter period, unless we're using it to beef up our Service's security, boost its features, or if we're legally required to keep it for longer.

### Transfer of Your Personal Data
Your info (yep, that includes your Personal Data!) gets processed at the Company's offices and wherever else the folks involved in handling it are located. This means your data might zip across borders and be stored on computers outside your state, province, country, or even governmental jurisdiction. Just a heads up that data protection laws in those places might be different from yours! 🌍

By giving a nod to this Privacy Policy and sending over your info, you're totally agreeing to that data transfer.

The Company is committed to taking every reasonable step to make sure your data is handled securely and according to this Privacy Policy. We won't transfer your Personal Data to any organization or country unless we're sure there are solid controls in place, including top-notch security for your data and other personal info.

### Delete Your Personal Data
You've got the power! 💪 You can totally delete, or ask us for a hand in deleting, the Personal Data we've collected about you.

Our Service might even let you delete some of your info directly from within the Service itself. Handy, right?

Wanna update, change, or zap your info? No problem! Just log into your Account (if you have one) and head to the account settings where you can manage your personal details. You can also just ping us to ask to access, correct, or delete any personal info you've given us.

Just a heads up, though: we might need to hold onto some info if we have a legal duty or a good reason to do so.

### Disclosure of Your Personal Data

#### Business Transactions
If the Company ever gets into a merger, acquisition, or sells off assets, your Personal Data might get transferred. We'll definitely give you a heads-up before your data moves and falls under a different Privacy Policy.

#### Law enforcement
Sometimes, the Company might have to spill your Personal Data if the law demands it, or if public authorities (like a court or government agency) make a valid request. It's not our first choice, but we gotta comply!

#### Other Legal Requirements
The Company might also disclose your Personal Data if we genuinely believe it's necessary to:
- Comply with a legal obligation
- Protect and defend the rights or property of the Company
- Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service
- Protect the personal safety of Users of the Service or the public
- Protect against legal liability

### Security of Your Personal Data
Your Personal Data's security is super important to us! 🔐 But hey, let's be real: no internet transmission or electronic storage method is ever 100% bulletproof. While we bust our chops to use commercially top-notch ways to protect your Personal Data, we just can't promise it's absolutely, totally secure.

## Children's Privacy
Our Service is definitely not for anyone under 13 years old. We're super careful not to knowingly collect any personal info from kids under 13. If you're a parent or guardian and you find out your child has given us Personal Data, please, please reach out! If we ever discover we've collected Personal Data from someone under 13 without getting parental consent first, we'll quickly wipe that info from our servers.

If we ever need your consent as the legal green light to process your info, and your country says a parent's consent is a must, then we might just ask for your parent's permission before we collect and use that info.

## Links to Other Websites
Our Service might have links to other websites that aren't run by us. Just so you know, if you click on a third-party link, you'll be whisked away to *their* site. We really, really recommend checking out the Privacy Policy of every single site you visit! ⚠️

We've got zero control over, and can't take responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services out there. Just a heads up!

## Changes to this Privacy Policy
We might tweak our Privacy Policy now and then. Don't worry, we'll let you know about any changes by simply posting the shiny new Privacy Policy right here on this page.

Before any changes officially kick in, we'll give you a heads-up via email and/or a noticeable announcement on our Service. We'll also update that "Last updated" date right at the top of this Privacy Policy.

So, it's a good idea to peek at this Privacy Policy every now and then to catch any changes. Changes to this policy become active the moment they're posted here.
