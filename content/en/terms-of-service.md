# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (referred to as "the Site" or "we")! 👋 Before you dive in and use our services, please take a moment to carefully read these Terms of Service. By accessing or using the Site, you're totally agreeing to and accepting these terms. Let's get started! 😊

## 1. About Our Services
**Our Services** 🚀 are here to empower you with paid subscription content and exclusive member services. We're talking awesome stuff like blog posts, premium resources, eBooks, community interactions, and so much more! Just a heads-up: some content is exclusively for our subscribed users.

## 2. Your Account & Registration
**To get an account**, you'll need to provide a valid email address and set up a password. Easy peasy!
*   **You're responsible** for keeping your account secure and for all activities that happen under it. Seriously, **do not** transfer or share your account with anyone else. That's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️
*   **The Site** has the right to **suspend or terminate** your account if you breach these terms. Play by the rules, folks!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
**Our subscription services** are billed on a monthly or annual basis, with all fees clearly stated on the checkout page. No hidden surprises! 💸
*   **All payments** are processed through trusted third-party payment platforms (like Stripe, PayPal). Rest assured, we **don't store** any of your payment information. Your data's safe with them!
*   **Subscriptions will auto-renew** 🔄 unless you cancel before your current billing cycle ends. Don't want it to renew? Just make sure to cancel in time!
*   **14-Day Refund Policy** 👇: If you're a first-time subscriber and not totally stoked about our service, you can request a full refund within 14 days of purchase. Just hit us up via the contact email provided at the end of these terms and tell us why you're not happy. Heads up: Each user gets **one refund chance only**. If it's been over 14 days or if this isn't your first rodeo with us, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law absolutely says otherwise.

## 4. Content Usage & Intellectual Property
**All original content on the Site** is **copyrighted by hubtoday** 🔒. Please, for the love of pixels, **do not** copy, reproduce, republish, or use our content for commercial purposes without our express permission.
*   **Users** are granted a **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** solely for personal learning and reading. It's for you, not for resale!
*   **Need to use it commercially** or planning a massive quote spree? 🗣️ Please reach out to us for authorization first!

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
**To keep our community awesome and safe**, certain behaviors are strictly **prohibited**: 🚫
*   **Do NOT** upload, post, or spread any content that is illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. Be cool, not cruel!
*   **Do NOT** attempt to bulk download, crawl, or crack member-exclusive content using technical means. Seriously, that's just wrong. 🛠️
*   **The Site** reserves the right to remove inappropriate content and **ban users** who violate these rules. We're not messing around here!

## 6. Service Changes & Interruptions
**We reserve the right** to change, suspend, or terminate parts or all of our services at any time, without prior notice. Think of it as evolving! 📈
*   **The Site** will **not be liable for compensation** if content becomes temporarily inaccessible due to force majeure, server failures, or third-party service interruptions. Sometimes things are just out of our hands! 🤷‍♀️

## 7. Disclaimer
**The information provided by the Site** is strictly for informational purposes only and **does NOT constitute** any form of professional advice (e.g., financial, legal, medical, etc.). Always consult a pro for that stuff! 🧐
*   **The Site** is **not responsible** for any direct or indirect losses incurred by users resulting from the use of our content or services. Use at your own discretion!

## 8. Governing Law
**These Terms of Service** are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its conflict of law principles. Keepin' it legal! ⚖️
*   **For any disputes** arising out of or related to these terms, both parties agree to first attempt to resolve the issue through friendly negotiation. If negotiations fail, you agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Santa Clara County, California.
