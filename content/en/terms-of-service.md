# Terms of Service

*Effective Date: June 1, 2025*

---

Welcome to **ai.hubtoday** (aka 'the Site' or 'us')! 🎉 Before you jump in and use our services, please give these Terms of Service a good read. Seriously! Your access or use of the Site means you're totally cool with and accepting these terms. Let's get started!

## 1. Service Introduction
Alright, so what's the deal here? **The Site** hooks users up with paid subscription content and super cool membership services. Think blog posts, exclusive resources, e-books, and awesome community interactions – you name it! Just remember, some of our juiciest content is exclusively for subscribers. 😉

## 2. User Registration and Account
Ready to sign up? **User accounts** are super easy to create. You'll just need a valid email address and a password. But listen up: **users** are fully responsible for their account's security and *all* activity happening on it. Seriously, **do NOT** transfer or share your account – that's a big no-no! 🙅‍♀️ And just so you know, if you ever break these terms, **the Site** has the right to **suspend or even terminate** your account. Fair warning!

## 3. Paid Subscription Services
Alright, let's talk about those sweet **Paid Subscription Services**. 💰 These are billed either monthly or annually, and you'll see all the costs super clearly on the checkout page – no hidden surprises! All payments zoom through secure third-party platforms (think Stripe, PayPal), so rest assured, **the Site** doesn't store any of your sensitive payment info. Plus, your subscription will **auto-renew** like clockwork unless you cancel it before your current billing cycle wraps up. Don't forget! <br><br> And hey, we've got a cool **14-Day Refund Policy** for first-timers! If you're not totally stoked with the service within 14 days of your *initial* purchase, you can totally ask for a full refund. Just drop us a line at the contact email at the end of these terms and tell us what's up. Each user gets one shot at this, though! After 14 days, or if you're a returning subscriber, payments are generally **non-refundable**, unless the law *really* says otherwise. Just being upfront! 😉

## 4. Content Use and Intellectual Property
Okay, moving onto **Content Use & Intellectual Property**. 🔐 Just a friendly heads-up: *all* the original content on **the Site** is **copyrighted by hubtoday**. That means you absolutely, positively **cannot** copy, reproduce, or use it for commercial purposes without our explicit permission. What you *do* get is a cool **non-exclusive, non-transferable access right** strictly for your personal learning and reading enjoyment. If you're thinking big – like commercial use or quoting a huge chunk – please, please, please reach out to **the Site** first to get that authorization. We appreciate it! 🙏

## 5. User Conduct Guidelines
Time for some rules about **User Conduct** – keep it classy, folks! 😇 Seriously, **DO NOT** upload, post, or spread any content that's illegal, harassing, false, offensive, or infringes on anyone else's rights. That's a big no-go. And another huge one: **DO NOT** try to bulk download, scrape, or even hack our member content using any sneaky technical means. **The Site** is totally within its rights to remove any dodgy content and will absolutely **ban users** who break these rules. Play fair, please! 🚫

## 6. Service Changes and Interruptions
Heads up about **Service Changes & Interruptions**! 🛠️ We totally reserve the right to tweak, suspend, or even completely terminate any part or all of our services at any time, without giving you a prior heads-up. Yeah, we know. Also, if content temporarily becomes unavailable due to wild cards like 'force majeure' (think natural disasters), server glitches, or third-party service outages, **the Site** unfortunately **can't be held liable for any compensation**. It's a bummer, but that's just how it rolls sometimes!

## 7. Disclaimer
Alright, let's get serious for a sec with our **Disclaimer**. ⚠️ Listen, the information **the Site** dishes out is purely for reference and **does NOT** constitute any form of professional advice – seriously, we're talking zero financial, legal, medical, or any other pro-level guidance here. And get this: for any direct or indirect losses that might pop up from you using our content or services, **the Site** is **absolutely not responsible**. We're just being crystal clear on that one! ✨

## 8. Governing Law
Okay, onto the nitty-gritty: **Governing Law**. ⚖️ These Terms of Service are governed by, and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of California, USA, totally disregarding any conflict of law principles. If any disagreements or disputes pop up *because of* or *related to* these terms, both parties should totally try to iron things out amicably first. No drama, right? But if that friendly chat doesn't quite work out, you agree to submit to the jurisdiction of the competent courts in Santa Clara County, California. Fair enough?
