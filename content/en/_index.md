### Product & Feature Updates

1.  **Claude Desktop now supports native Claude Code.**
    Good news for developers who aren't fans of the command line! 🎉 You can now use Claude Code directly within [Claude Desktop (AI News)](https://claude.ai/download) with a graphical interface. Just enable the "Code" switch in the sidebar, authorize a folder, and boom — Claude helps you write code and tweak projects. It even supports **multi-task parallelism**, letting multiple sessions run without interference, like working on several branches at once. Enterprise users also get permission control, ensuring security. Super neat! ✨<br/>![AI News: Claude Desktop Code Feature Toggle Interface](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kechshz0f1at9a6fahbmve5f.avif)<br/>

2.  **Cursor launches dynamic context discovery mode.**
    Traditional AI assistants tend to dump all info into the prompt box, causing token consumption to skyrocket 💸. **Cursor** flips this on its head! Its Agent dynamically pulls context only when needed, keeping prompts lean. The [Official Blog (AI News)](https://cursor.com/blog/dynamic-context-discovery) reports that token consumption **decreases by an average of 46.9%** when using MCP tools. Got a super long chat history? Just convert it into a file and let the Agent search it – no more losing track of details! 😎<br/>![AI News: Cursor Dynamic Context Discovery Architecture Diagram](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kechsqn8fjrsmnrxyza86ehp.avif)<br/>

3.  **Razer unveils Project Ava, a holographic AI desktop companion, at CES.**
    Imagine a 5.5-inch holographic capsule housing a fiery 🔥 anime girl who can peek at your screen and even you! At [CES 2026 (AI News)](https://www.jiqizhixin.com/articles/2026-01-07-12), **Razer** showcased this AI companion, powered by **Elon Musk's xAI Grok**. You can currently pick from 5 personas, including anime girl Kira and muscle-bound Zane. Pre-orders are just $20, and the company is boldly claiming they'll sell a **billion units**. Just be warned, it seems to have inherited Grok's rather "flirty" personality too. 😉

4.  **Liquid AI releases the LFM2.5 family of edge-side small models.**
    Built specifically for edge devices and local deployment 💡, **Liquid AI's LFM2.5** boasts 1.2B parameters and scores an impressive **38.89 on GPQA**. The [Open-Source Weights (AI News)](https://www.liquid.ai/blog/introducing-lfm2-5-the-next-generation-of-on-device-ai) are already out on Hugging Face. There are also Japanese-specialized, visual-language, and audio-language versions, with the audio model's anti-tokenizer running **8 times faster** than before – perfect for real-time voice conversations! 🚀<br/>![AI News: LFM2.5 Model Performance Benchmark Comparison Chart](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kechsyx9eyhvmb7890y28cwx.avif)<br/>

### Cutting-Edge Research

1.  **VTONQA: The first virtual try-on quality assessment dataset is released.**
    Ever notice how online shopping try-on photos often look distorted or weird? 😅 Well, now there's a dedicated standard for evaluating them. The [arXiv Paper (AI News)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02945) introduces **VTONQA**, a dataset featuring **8,132 images** generated by 11 different try-on models. These images are scored across three dimensions: garment fit, body compatibility, and overall quality. This release highlights the limitations of current models and points developers in the right direction. 🎯

2.  **CodeEvolve: An open-source evolutionary code generation framework.**
    Meet **CodeEvolve**, a framework that merges large language models with evolutionary search 🧬 to synthesize high-performance algorithms. The [GitHub Open Source (AI News)](https://github.com/inter-co/science-codeevolve) project shows it outperforms AlphaEvolve in benchmark tests. It's wild that an open-source model can rival closed-source solutions, and with just a **fraction of the computing cost**! Talk about efficiency! 🤯

### Industry Outlook & Societal Impact

1.  **Andrew Ng proposes a new "Turing-AGI Test" standard.**
    For his first tweet of the new year 🎊, instead of predicting AI's prowess, **Andrew Ng** actually asked how to determine if AGI has arrived. His [Andrew Ng's Tweet (AI News)](https://x.com/dotey/status/2008709530654216567) suggests: Give an AI a computer with internet access and have it work continuously for several days like a remote employee – taking training, handling customers, and receiving feedback. If it performs as well as a skilled human employee, it passes. Interestingly, he notes the most effective part of the classic Turing Test is deliberately making **typos**! 🤔

2.  **Nvidia unveils the Vera Rubin platform.**
    **Nvidia** just dropped a huge bomb at CES 🚀: their new Vera Rubin platform can train 10-trillion-parameter models using only a **quarter** of the Blackwell chip count, cutting training time down to a single month! The [Inference Cost (AI News)](https://x.com/vista8/status/2008876426255270106) is slashed to just one-tenth, with shipments planned for the second half of the year. Get ready! 💥

3.  **Reddit post with thousands of upvotes confirmed to be AI-fabricated.**
    A viral Reddit post accusing a food delivery platform of fraud racked up an astonishing **87,000 upvotes**, but it turns out the whole thing was cooked up by AI! 😱 The [AIbase Report (AI News)](https://www.aibase.com/zh/news/24336) reveals that both the alleged "employee ID" and 18 pages of "technical documents" showed signs of AI generation. And here's the kicker 🔍: the scam was actually exposed by another AI, using Google Gemini's SynthID watermark technology. AI fighting AI – what a twist!

4.  **AI penetration testing agents show impressive performance but have limitations.**
    Stanford research reveals that **AI penetration bots** cost less than **$60/hour** and can beat 9 out of 10 human testers! That's insane! But, as a [Hacker News Discussion (AI News)](https://newshacker.me/story?id=46518996) points out, about 18% of their findings are false positives, and they've even missed some obvious vulnerabilities. While network penetration is highly automated, application-layer testing still needs human judgment. So, humans aren't totally obsolete yet. 😉

### Top Open-Source Projects

1.  **googletest: Google's testing framework.**
    The industry standard for C++ testing and mocking frameworks, **googletest** (⭐**37.7k** on GitHub), is still actively updated on its [GitHub Repository (AI News)](https://github.com/google/googletest). It's an old friend for anyone writing unit tests – stable and reliable. A true classic! 🏆

### Social Media Shares

1.  **Learn Agent Skills building with Anthropic.**
    @shao\_\_meng summarized the key takeaways from the [Official Blog (AI News)](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) on building **Anthropic Agent Skills**. Pro-tip: use gerunds for names like "processing-pdfs," and describe in the third person 💡. The golden rule is "only provide information Claude doesn't already know" – because tokens are pricey! A validation loop is also crucial; make Claude copy a checklist and tick things off before executing. Smart move! ✅<br/>![AI News: Agent Skills Building Best Practices Guide](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kecht5gge5sv6d66bbdqaqj4.avif)<br/>

5.  **2026 general money-making methodology.**
    @Yangyixxxx has proposed a [Three-Step Method (AI News)](https://x.com/Yangyixxxx/status/2008733816119251101) for 2026's general money-making methodology: 1) Find high-quality information sources, 2) Let AI analyze and summarize, then 3) Form a knowledge base that feeds back into the AI 🔄. By letting AI learn while you learn, you'll end up with an AI that possesses expert know-how. Smart strategy! 🧠

6.  **Logitech mouse driver certificate expiration issue causes chaos.**
    It's a blunder reminiscent of League of Legends' own issues 😅! **Logitech's mouse driver certificate** has expired, causing a headache for users. The [Solution (AI News)](https://x.com/op7418/status/2008748491217268949) involves setting your date back to yesterday, launching and configuring the driver, then closing it and resetting your date. Seriously, Logitech, how has this not been fixed after so long? 🤦‍♂️<br/>![AI News: Logitech Driver Certificate Expiration Error Message](https://source.hubtoday.app/images/2026/01/news_01kechtwmjefdvy992x948qqqw.avif)<br/>
